I have used used Firebase to persist data, along with Vuex centralised state.


I didn't worked much with Vue & Vuex in the past, as I was primarily React developer, but this appeared challenging to me and I wanted to take a chance.


I spend around 3-4 hours on this including setting up the project from zero, with webpack and other libs.


Maybe component can be adapted to call fetching data api from within itself without relying on Vuex store.


My favorite css property is animation as it gives 'life' to elements and one can make very interesting things with it.


Favourite modern Javascript feature for me could be template strings - they are very useful.


I didn't worked with Vue in the past so I am not sure about favourite third party library. I saw that there is available many great libraries.



Run this project:

npm install


npm start
